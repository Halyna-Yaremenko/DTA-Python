    "__Pandas__ is a popular Python package for exploration and analysis of large datasets. You'll get an intuition for what that means through the course of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you even want to use a complex package such as _Pandas_ with its own data structures, long documentation and way of thinking, when you could potentially do any data analysis imaginable using the ordinary Python data structures and functionality we've already learned?\n",
    "There are two main reasons:\n",
    "1. __Performance__ - Python is a very convenient language in many regards, but this convenience comes at a cost - performance.\n",
    "We might not have run into slowdowns thus far, but once we start handling huge amounts of data, pure Python quickly reaches its limits.\n",
    "_Pandas_ provides its own data structures which trade some convenience for __huge gains in performance__ by internally utilizing _Numpy_.\n",
    "2. __Convenience__ - _Pandas_ provides a lot of ready-to-use high level functions for common data analysis tasks, which would be time-consuming, error-prone and tedious to write by hand.\n",
    "We'll see examples of this in the form of _grouping_, _resampling time series_ and _filtering_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing data science effectively always involves working with __incomplete__ and __inconveniently formatted data__, hence a large part of this work is adapting to the input format and cleaning data.\n",
    "Most importantly, we should always ask ourselves whether what we see in terms of data, be it input data or derived, makes sense within our domain - and if it doesn't, investigate and try to find the culprit.\n",
    "It may seem a little unglamerous, but 90% of data science is importing data correctly and accounting for missing data and cleaning what we have found. We'll try to replicate a bit of that experience here.\n",
    "\n",
